# Username/Group Mentions

This NodeBB plugin allows posters to reference (or *mention*) other users or groups on a NodeBB by simply
precluding the `@` symbol before a username.

A link is automatically added to the post.

## Installation

This plugin is bundled with every NodeBB install. If not, you can install it via the Plugins page of the ACP.

Alternatively,

    npm install nodebb-plugin-mentions
